# Starts the program, while loop and prompts the user for terms in the formula
# Every time the next term is entered the new formula is calculated and printed.

# The user can then test the formula for all the past values (may be in a visual way??? -> Formula stays still and  the  n  is replaced with its value and dynamically calculated in the formula)
